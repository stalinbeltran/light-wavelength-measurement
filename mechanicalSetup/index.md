#Mechanical setup
This is the mechanical part of the experiment. In order to detect the change in the wavelength of light, we need a mirror moving as fast as possible. If the speed is too slow, no noticeable difference will be measured.
Of course, this is not easy. But after several failures, I found a way of doing it that must work.

An slider + rail was attached to a 2x4 wood that makes a reasonable (but far from perfect) base for the rail. This should not be tightened, or the rail may conform to any curvature of the wood.
A Nema 23 stepper motor plus some 2GT pulleys make a speed "increaser" (yes, this is the opposed to a speed reducer).
That way, the motor can work at low speed (where it is stronger) while the slider moves 9 times faster.
The motor is powerful enough to generate an appreciable speed on the slider, but the acceleration became stronger too in order to achieve such speeds in a 50 cm rail.
